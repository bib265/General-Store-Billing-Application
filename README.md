# General-Store-Billing-Application

This is a project i created with a group of my college classmates as a semester project. 
Supermarket is the place where customers come to purchase their daily using products and pay for that.
So, there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to generate the bill for the customer. 
The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment and full- fledged computer software, fulfilling the requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
For easy and convenient processing, we need to develop software, which work as per our requirements.
While preparing this software we got to remember few things i.e., this software must have a friendly environment, in other words it should not be much complicated to handle, it should have option for future modification in the database i.e., in the goods list, new items and workers list. 
For smooth functioning we had to prepare a database by which we could enter the required data in their respective locations. 
In this database all the record of daily entry made are stored, so that we can use them in future whenever allotted to their caretaker. 
Other than that, no one could use this and on entering an illegal password or login name an error message get displayed.
